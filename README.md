# MCMC-Thesis-Project

Hello!

I would like to share Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) code with Metropolis Hastings algorithm using Python programming language to fitting the rotation curve of galaxies. This code are written to finish my last project to get Bachelor and Master Degree from my institute last year. 

To run this code you need the following packages:
1. numpy
2. scipy
3. matplotlib (optional)

Don't hesitate to contact me at wulanddarii18@gmail.com if any question about this code.

Enjoy it!
