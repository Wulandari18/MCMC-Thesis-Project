# MCMC-Thesis-Project

Hello!

I would like to share the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) code with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm using Python programming language to fitting the rotation curve of galaxies. This code is written to finish my last project to get a Bachelor's and Master's Degree from my institute last year.

To run this code you need the following packages:
1. NumPy
2. SciPy
3. matplotlib (optional)

Don't hesitate to contact me at wulanddarii18@gmail.com if any questions about this code.

Enjoy it!
